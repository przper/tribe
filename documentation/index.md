# Tribe

## Description
Application to manage the family - my own *Tribe*

## General
- This is a "free time" project to practice software archtitecture and design on my own.
- This application will use Domain Driven Design. List of Bounded Contexts:
  - [FoodRecipes](./FoodRecipes/index.md)
  - [WorkedTime](./WorkedTime/index.md)
  - [Provisioning (GroceryList)](./Provisioning/index.md)
  - Shared
- I am considering a `Virtual Private Server` instead of shared hosting and use docker images with CI/CD pipeline
